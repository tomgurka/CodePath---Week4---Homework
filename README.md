Pinching images in the canvas area should resize them 

I ran out of time trying to make this work. was only able to get the draggable object from the shelf working on monday night during lab. I could not get my scale recognizer to 
even pick up the scale attempt. I'm also trying to finish the wireframes due for the group project at the same time. This was not a good week.
